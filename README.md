## 📌 Introduction

This project focuses on developing a **camera-based hand tracking system** that enables natural hand gesture interactions within a virtual 3D environment. Using **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **Unity**, we provide a **cost-effective** and **intuitive** alternative to traditional VR/AR setups.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- 🎥 **OpenCV** captures real-time video from a webcam.
- ✋ **MediaPipe** extracts 21 2D hand landmarks per frame.
- 🧠 Post-processing infers 3D hand positions and gestures.
- 🔄 3D coordinates are streamed into a **Unity** scene.
- 🖐️ A virtual hand mimics user movement for immersive interaction.

> Users can **grab, rotate, zoom, and move objects** with just their hands.

## 🌌 Demo: Solar System Simulation

As a proof-of-concept, we created a mini **solar system** in Unity:

- 🪐 Touch planets to reveal educational info.
- 🌍 Grab and move Earth to alter orbit.
- 🎮 Rotate the environment with hand gestures.

> This demo showcases the potential for **interactive educational games and programs**.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **📸 Accessibility**: Works with a basic webcam—no VR headset needed!
- **🖱️ Intuitive Gestures**: Interact without a mouse or controller.
- **🎓 Education-Ready**: Great for learning physics and space science.
- **🕹️ Versatile**: Use in games, virtual meetings, or simulations.
